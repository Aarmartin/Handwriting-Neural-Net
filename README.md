# Handwriting-Neural-Net
Expansion on a program that implements a Neural Net to recognize handwriting, written in Python.

The goal of this program is to take in a handwritten image of a number and determine its associated value using neural networking algorithms.

This code implements a feedforward backpropagation multilayered neural network for processing.
